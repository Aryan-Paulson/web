  <h1>Delivery and Returns Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 17 January, 2025</p>

  <h3>b. Shipping Charges</h3>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Orders below 500 INR:</strong> A shipping charge of <strong>40 INR</strong> will be applied to your order.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>c. Order Processing and Delivery</h3>
  <p>Orders are processed within <strong>1-2 business days</strong> of receipt, and we will notify you with a tracking number once your order has been dispatched. Please note that delivery times may vary depending on the location and external factors.</p>

  <h3>d. Shipping Delays</h3>
  <p>While we make every effort to ensure timely delivery, please be aware that there may be occasional delays due to weather, holidays, or logistical issues. We will inform you of any significant delays.</p>

  <h2>2. Returns and Exchanges</h2>
  <p>We offer a flexible return policy to ensure you are satisfied with your purchase.</p>

  <h3>a. Return Eligibility</h3>
  <p>You may return an item within <strong>7 days of delivery</strong>, provided the item is unused and in its original condition with all packaging intact. The return process must be initiated within this period.</p>

  <h3>b. Return Process</h3>
  <p>To initiate a return:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Contact our customer service at <strong><a href="tomail:thecollectorsden1@gmail.com" target="_blank_">thecollectorsden1@gmail.com</a></strong> within 7 days of receiving your order.</li>
      <li>Provide your order number, the item to be returned, and the reason for the return.</li>
      <li>Pack the item securely and ship it back to us.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Customers are responsible for the return shipping charges unless the item is defective or damaged.</p>

  <h3>c. Refund Policy</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Refunds will be processed once the returned item is received and inspected.</li>
      <li>If the packaging of exquisite products (such as Hot Wheels) is found damaged or torn, no refund will be processed. Instead, a <strong>20 INR charge</strong> will apply for reshipping the item back to the customer.</li>
      <li>If the reshipping charge is not paid within <strong>20 days</strong>, the item will not be returned, and no compensation will be offered.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>d. Exchanges</h3>
  <p>If you would like to exchange an item, please contact us within <strong>7 days</strong> of receiving the order. Exchanges are subject to stock availability and may incur additional charges for the replacement product.</p>

  <h3>e. Non-Returnable Items</h3>
  <p>Some items, such as those that have been opened or used, personalized items, and gift cards, cannot be returned. Exquisite products like Hot Wheels with damaged packaging are also non-returnable for a refund.</p>

  <h3>f. Damaged or Defective Items</h3>
  <p>If you receive a damaged or defective item, please contact us immediately. We will guide you through the process of obtaining a replacement or refund, where applicable.</p>

  <h3>g. Color Discrepancy</h3>
  <p>The color of the product may vary slightly due to lighting, monitor settings, or other factors. Color will <strong>not</strong> be considered a valid reason for a refund. However, it may be eligible for <strong>replacement</strong> under the conditions outlined in this policy if the discrepancy significantly differs from the description or images provided on the website.</p>

  <h2>3. Cancellations</h2>
  <p>Orders can be canceled within <strong>24 hours</strong> of purchase. After this period, the order may have already been processed or shipped, and cancellation may no longer be possible. If we cancel the order on our end, <strong>compensation will be processed</strong> for the customer.</p>

  <h2>4. Force Majeure (Godly Incidents)</h2>
  <p>In the event of unforeseen circumstances such as natural disasters (e.g., floods, earthquakes) or other force majeure events, we are not responsible for any <strong>delays in delivery</strong>. While we will make reasonable efforts to fulfill the order, the delivery time may be extended beyond our control, and we will not be held liable for these delays.</p>
